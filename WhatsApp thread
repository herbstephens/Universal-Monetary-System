[8:59 AM, 7/24/2018] Sara: Hello all and thank you Michael ‚ò∫
[11:15 AM, 7/24/2018] +254 729 771090: Hi everyone. Thank you Michael
[11:32 AM, 7/24/2018] +1 (917) 940-6606: What are next steps with this working group?!
[5:34 PM, 7/24/2018] Michael Sung: Hi all, I have gotten all of the interested participants into this working group now. Here is a link if you want to invite any other interested parties, would love to get as many domain experts to contribute!
[5:37 PM, 7/24/2018] Michael Sung: I think the best thing to start with is a brief introduction from each person, including any relevant experience, ideas or specific interest(s) related to the working group mandate
[5:42 PM, 7/24/2018] +34 684 08 90 13: Just to make sure i don't say anything stupid or maybe I am late to this group, have you already shared the "working group mandate" itself or is it up for discussion too?
[5:45 PM, 7/24/2018] Michael Sung: @juan just a loose mandate at this point. I think the main focus should just to stimulate discussion, ideas, debate even on what should be focusing on in terms of developing a universal monetary system that encompasses all the values and features we would like to see in such as System
[5:51 PM, 7/24/2018] +34 684 08 90 13: Ok thanks :). Maybe I can introduce myself then to start. Juan from Spain. Working on trust and reputation for the last 6 years. Gap of trust as an economic and social limit to financial opportunities. Reputation as risk premium in society. Sociometrics of trust. Homophily and mirror biases in trust networks. Working specifically on alternatives to credit scores that are based on staking reputation and liquid networks of trust as opposed to just credit scores based on previous debt. That's the kind of expertise I can bring :)
[5:59 PM, 7/24/2018] Michael Sung: I‚Äôll kick things off with my intro: I‚Äôm a tech investor that focuses on cross border deals to connect international innovation to China. I launched the One World Blockchain Alliance at Davos this past year to bridge international blockchain ecosystem companies to China‚Äôs Belt and Road projects in the developing world. I also run the Fanhai Fintech Research Center at Fudan University in Shanghai, and as such have active research programs in cryptoeconomics, tokenomics, cryptofinancing innovation, etc. I am also founding faculty of the national-level China Institute for Economics and Finance, a think thank for topics such as ICO regulation, crypto legislation, etc. My bio: https://www.emtechhk.com/conference/steering-committee. I am very passionate about the possibility of creating a new monetary system leveraging blockchain innovation that serves the people and not just the elites. Very excited to synergize with everyone here and do my part to help put together a credible proposal for next year‚Äôs Bretton Woods! Let‚Äôs change the world together!
[6:01 PM, 7/24/2018] Michael Sung: Oops forgot to include the group  invite link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/55uuoJBCrW31ijEWoGkS3p
[1:47 AM, 7/25/2018] +1 (917) 940-6606: So happy to be part of this group and sad I didn't get to meet you in person as I missed the BW event. I am an author and entrepreneur. My books include Breaking Open the Head (on psychedelic shamanism), 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl (on indigenous knowledge systems), and How Soon Is Now (www.howsoonisnow.info), which looks at the ecological crisis as a collective rite of passage for humanity and proposes how we can redesign our social and technical systems to avoid otherwise inevitable catastrophe. I also edited Charles Eisenstein's Sacred Economics and an anthology of essays, What Comes After Money?, exploring alternatives to our current financial system. In terms of the urgency we are facing collectively, I tend to think it is "blockchain or bust"! I also ran a think tank, Center for Planetary Culture, that created a Regenerative Society Wiki: http://www.planetaryculture.info/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page . Our idea was to assemble a database of the best transformative projects and approaches for systemic change. My approach to the UMS would be to combine ideas from Tom Greco (The End of Money and the Future of Civilization) and Bernard Lietaer (The Future of Money): Combine Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) with a global trading currency with a negative interest charge. I also think pegging the new currency to renewable energy would be a great way to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. Happy to explain these ideas in more depth here and also excited to learn from all of you.
[1:53 AM, 7/25/2018] Chris Traub: Amazing, Daniel!    All, I'm Chris Traub, and met quite a few folks at the GEV gathering.  I have been in Asia for 32 years, and have run SES, an Executive Search and Human Capital Advisory firm (www.sesasia.com) for the past 30 years.  I am also launching Vortex (www.vortexglobal.net), the Global Transformation Leadership Community, in Morocco this October.  These activities have led me to become a member in many global leadership communities (Forbes, World Economic Forum, TED, Summit, and many more) - which has led to the area in which I'm likely to be able to contribute most to this wonderful initiative.    I'm happy to help out whereever I can to help connect the community to global thought leaders across countries, reasons, and disciplines.   Very much looking forward to getting to know all of you.üôè
[6:08 AM, 7/25/2018] +1 (541) 740-6121: Hi all.  Very honored to be included.   My name is Gregory Landua. I am an eco-social entrepreneur, and author.  I co-authored Regenerative Enterprise v1.0 (2012) and a series of well read whitepapers focused on regenerative agriculture and multi-capital approaches to business.  My focus in agro-ecological health and as such I founded the blockchain powered start up Www.regen.network to work towards creating a basket of living capital currencies based on Bioregional health indicators such as soil health, water quality, biodiversity etc.  Please note this aim is ambitious enough and challenging enough technically that our to market plan has simpler more immediately profitable goals such as monitoring and monetizing the increases in ecological health of farms to give farmers another income stream.   I‚Äôve been in the complementary currency and LETS space and Ecovillage communities for some years, and as such helped create an education backed digital currency in 2008.  As noted above my 110% Focus at the moment is building the digital infrastructure to make trusted observations and subsequent attestations and smart contracts about ecological health possible at scale.    Habla for convening the Group.   May our conversation and cooperation be deeply regenerative for all.  üôèüèΩüå±
[8:23 PM, 7/25/2018] +254 729 771090: Hi. I am Caroline Dama. I work with rural and peri urban communities to empower them economically using community currencies. We concentrate on aspects how to help them formalize their own debt structures and enable them see that as long as they have goods and services to offer each other they can meet their basics needs even when they lack the national currency.
[8:26 PM, 7/25/2018] +254 729 771090: We are also keen on environmental issues and sustainable use of the environment and we came to see The state of communities' economy affects how well they use the environment hence a need to make sure restoration of the environment goes hand in hand with economic empowerment.
[1:13 AM, 7/26/2018] +1 (917) 940-6606: Hi @Gregory Landua I am looking at your White Paper and some ancillary articles. It feels a bit byzantine in its complexity - or perhaps I am missing something. Is this what you basically mean: You will use a global network of sensors to monitor ecosystem health and health of farmer's soil etc. You will create "tokens" (based on smart contracts) that farmers (and others?) accrue as they enhance their local ecosystem. These tokens will be sold on a market. Is that it basically?
[1:16 AM, 7/26/2018] +1 (917) 940-6606: Hi @Dama - your work sounds amazing. Can you offer some specific examples of where you have helped implement these community currencies? Not sure what you mean by "formalize their own debt structures." Can you explain?
[1:19 AM, 7/26/2018] +1 (917) 940-6606: Hi @Michael Sung you write: "I am very passionate about the possibility of creating a new monetary system leveraging blockchain innovation that serves the people and not just the elites." I am curious how you envision this? Do you have particular models or approaches in mind?
[2:41 AM, 7/26/2018] +254 729 771090: We have 6 community currencies in Kenya in different geographical areas. Some are in peri urban areas - slums and one is a rural currency.
[2:44 AM, 7/26/2018] +254 729 771090: By formalizing debt I mean the communities we work with usually have debts they incur due to lack of liquidity as they seek to meet their daily needs and usually they go to each other to get goods and services so they can pay later. The community currency gives them a chance to be able to go on with trade even in absence of national currency.
[2:47 AM, 7/26/2018] +254 729 771090: Essentially the community currency gives them a chance to back each other up... No need to lack some basic needs or go into debt yet everyone has something to offer the community in form of goods... Services or even their time
[6:39 AM, 7/26/2018] +1 (541) 740-6121: we facilitate the existing and ever evolving data collection mechanisms (sensors - machine or human) to be used to bring ecosystem health information where it is needed for true cost accounting and better valuation of ecosystem health.  One way this may be achieved is tokenization of natural and living capital.   This tokenization has a continuum of fungibility depending on context.  
The aim to start our exploration was currency backed by living capital.   The complexity you‚Äôre picking up on (I believe) is due to the current fragmentation in the space.   I‚Äôd argue our architecture is actually a nice simple-complex balance, but I am really interested in the perspective you‚Äôve shared.   It gives me some food for thought.
